## 📌 What This Project Is  
This repository is my **Learn-in-Public DevOps journey**, where I document everything I study, build, break, fix, and master while becoming a top-level DevOps engineer.

I’m sharing everything publicly so:  
- Others can learn with me  
- I build consistency  
- I create real proof of work  
- My learning becomes long-term and revision-friendly  

This repo will grow into a **full DevOps curriculum**, covering:

✔ Linux  
✔ Git & GitHub  
✔ Shell Scripting  
✔ Networking  
✔ AWS / Azure / GCP Concepts  
✔ Docker  
✔ Kubernetes  
✔ Terraform  
✔ Ansible  
✔ Jenkins & CI/CD  
✔ Observability (Grafana, Prometheus)  
✔ DevOps Projects  
✔ SRE Systems  
✔ Cloud Architecture  
✔ And real production-grade troubleshooting

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository  
This is not theory.  
This is **hands-on, practical DevOps** written from real learning, real debugging, and real experience.

By the end of this journey I will have:  
- A complete DevOps knowledge base  
- A public portfolio of proof-of-work  
- Multiple deployable DevOps projects  
- A trackable roadmap from beginner → advanced  

And anyone following this repo can learn along with me.
